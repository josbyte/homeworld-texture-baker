# homeworld-texture-baker
A lightweight tool for baking Homeworld Remastered (HWRM) textures diffuse, team, and glow maps into a single combined texture. Ideal for workflows where team files are unnecessary or unsupported. Simpler and significantly faster than baking with Unreal Engine.

This tool generates textures entirely from user input; no original Homeworld assets are included or provided.

Purpose: This program is intended to support modders and artists (including, but not limited to, works inspired by Homeworld) and their application in other projects whose textures may happen to function like those in Homeworld.

Rights over textures: All textures, images, and graphical assets created by users or contributors remain the property and copyright of their respective creators prior to being used in this program. Users of this software must ensure they hold the appropriate licenses if they intend to use the output generated by the program.

Use of the software vs. use of assets: Using this software does not grant any rights or licenses over third-party textures. Users are solely responsible for verifying and obtaining any necessary permissions or licenses to use, modify, or redistribute textures created by others.

Disclaimer of liability: The author/developer of this program is not responsible for any claims, damages, losses, or costs arising from the use of textures or assets without proper authorization. Any disputes concerning the intellectual property of textures must be resolved directly between the rights holder and the user.

Recommendation: Before distributing a mod or package that includes textures created by third parties, obtain written permission or a license from the textureâ€™s creator and document its provenance.
